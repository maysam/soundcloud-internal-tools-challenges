## SoundCloud Internal Tools Challenges

Greetings, dear candidate,

Thanks for taking the time to do our challenges!

In this folder, you'll find two subdirectories, each containing one challenge and a README.md file with the instructions. These deal with different skill areas. You might not be equally strong in all areas, but that's ok! We are looking to find out what your skill profile is. Attempt all of the tasks.

All submissions are reviewed anonymously, so please don't include your name or any other identifying information within the code (including generated files, such as package.json) and any notes you submit. A zip of the code rather than a git repository is also preferable for the same reason.

Good luck, we hope you have fun!

*PS: At SoundCloud, we're always looking to improve everything we do, and these challenges are no exception. If you want to provide any feedback about the process or the individual challenges themselves, please feel free to include a note about it. This is __entirely__ optional: providing negative feedback or none at all won't affect the judging.*

*PPS: Each task's instructions contains the amount of time we estimate it should take to complete. This is provided for your benefit so you can plan your time in advance. It is completely fine if you take more or less time than this -- it is not part of the judging criteria -- but if you could let us know how it went, then we can adjust our estimates for those who come after you.*
